## Workflow 

* Fetch all Biosample data using `fetch_biosample.py` and validate 
* Create table of fields and create database tables `create_db.py`
* Create prompts for each record `create_prompt.py`

## Scripts

## fetch_and_prompt.py
fetch_and_prompt.py is a Python script that fetches biosample IDs from an enterobase table, fetches missing biosamples, and generates prompt text files for each biosample file in the specified directory. It contains several functions that perform different tasks, and can be useful for researchers who need to fetch biosamples and generate prompt text files for machine learning models.
